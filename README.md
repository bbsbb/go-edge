# Go Edge

An experimental opinionated setup for golang app development inspired by my current agent usage and
[this article](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/).


## Why?

I have always enjoyed working with clear boundaries, often the teams that perform well
have been teams where there is strong alignment on practices and correct feedback loops
to revisit and evolve them. I genuinely do not see a raeson for this not to be the case
for agents, if anything, I find it likelty that guard rails are a multiplier on agentic
productivity.

We will see how it goes.

## How to use it?

Just fork it. Change what you like, get rid of what you don't. Do not use it as a dependency via
actual go modules..
If I end up adding something you like - you can always come back to it later. For now, fork
and code away.

## What's in it?

Checkout the repository, throw it into your favorite agentic tool and ask it what is this about.
See if you like the answer or not.
Check the tech-debt docs for summary of things I will be adding.


## Changelog

[2026-02-15] - This is the initial version.


# Disclaimner

This Readme is the only file in this repository that never gets touched by agents or LLM.
Everything else is very likely to not get code from an actual editor.
